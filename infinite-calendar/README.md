# Hair Journal Calendar

# A smooth infinite scrolling calendar for tracking hair care routines. Built this as a coding assignment but honestly had way too much fun with the animations.

# What it does

# Basically an endless calendar where you can scroll up and down through months forever without any janky loading. Each day shows little hair journal entries with photos, and clicking them opens a swipeable card view. The header updates automatically as you scroll to show which month you're looking at.

# Running it locally

# npm install (install node modules)

# npm start

# Tech stuff I used

# React 19 with TypeScript

# Tailwind CSS for styling

# date-fns for date manipulation (because vanilla JS dates are painful)

# Lucide React for icons
